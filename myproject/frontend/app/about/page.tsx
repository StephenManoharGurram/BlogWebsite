          About This Space
        </h1>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          This website is a quiet corner of the internet, built to help you slow
          down and remember the moments when God blessed you. It&apos;s not about
          noise, likes, or trends — it&apos;s about gratitude, reflection, and
          simple goodness.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          My friend shares messages, stories, and small reminders here. Each
          one is meant to nudge you gently toward kindness: toward God, toward
          others, and toward yourself.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Over time, this space will grow with reflections, blessings, and
          stories — but the design will stay simple, quiet, and honest. Just
          like the moments it celebrates.
        </p>
